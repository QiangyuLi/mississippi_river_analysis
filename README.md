# mississippi_river_analysis

Jupyter-based analysis and visualization of the Mississippi River Basin watershed.

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Mississippi River Basin using Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis includes data collection, cleaning, visualization, and interpretation of various hydrological and environmental parameters.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks used for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `results/`: Output files and visualizations generated from the analysis.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
